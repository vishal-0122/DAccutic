Project Overview: DAccutic is a machine learning project aimed at predicting whether employees in an organization earn more than 50k USD based on a variety of features available in the dataset. The project explores the application of five different classification models: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, and Decision Tree.

Objectives:
To analyze the dataset and identify the most relevant features influencing employee salary.
To apply five popular machine learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, Random Forest, and Decision Tree) to predict whether an employee earns more than 50k USD.
To evaluate the performance of these models and determine which one provides the best accuracy.

Methodology:
Data Preprocessing: The dataset is cleaned, with missing values handled and categorical features appropriately encoded.
Model Training: The five machine learning models are trained on the dataset, using cross-validation techniques to avoid overfitting.
Performance Evaluation: The models are evaluated using accuracy as the primary metric, comparing their performances to determine the best model for predicting employee salaries.

Results: The project provides insights into the relative effectiveness of different machine learning algorithms in predicting employee salary based on the dataset, with a focus on maximizing accuracy.
